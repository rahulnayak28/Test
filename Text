Back Then: Marriages are made in heaven. No one can support the saying more than Nitin and Hema. It was a blissful, god blessed arranged matrimony. Nitin was an extremely humble, gullible godsend child kind of a guy. He still is! Hema is an extremely shy, introvert, petite and talented girl.
Both hailed their roots from the same small town. Parents arranged a social meeting, which was where Nitin met Hema for the first time. He was so excited to see the girl, he bought an amazing embroided jeans paired with any extremely ill- fitted out of fashion casual shirt. Needless to say, he was looking out of this world. That was the kind of fashion taste he used to have. Hema also didn’t followed fashion meticulously, but she was much much better than Nitin is this regard.
Both met. They kind of clicked. 
Present: Somewhere in the city, Advocate Anil Sharma’s office:
Anil- “Ok, are you sure you two want to file a divorce by mutual consent petition ?
Hema- Yes
Nitin- Yes 


It is a process. Love starts with a crush, proceeds to infatuation, peaks at either being a rejection, or an obsession, and may end up in break-up or worse, marriage!!!
Adi was a shy guy, not a pro with girls. So instead of flirting with Ananya to get her attention, he took up the boring ‘first be friends, then become best friends, finally be friend-zoned in favour of a hunk’. Sneha, was the glue between them. She knew from the beginning about Adi’s feelings. She was cool with them, not wanting to be the reason of their potential
alliance or enmity. The reason she did not wanted to push Ananya for Adi was that she also knew about Ananya’s heartbreak.
Ananya was badly broke and depressed. Her Ex-boyfriend met with an accident about three months ago, and unfortunately couldn’t survive. This led her further into severe trauma and she was not able to accept the fate. 
She still had feelings for him. So did Adi for her.
