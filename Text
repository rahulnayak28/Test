Back Then: Marriages are made in heaven. No one can support the saying more than Nitin and Hema. It was a blissful, god blessed arranged matrimony. Nitin was an extremely humble, gullible godsend child kind of a guy. He still is! Hema is an extremely shy, introvert, petite and talented girl.
Both hailed their roots from the same small town. Parents arranged a social meeting, which was where Nitin met Hema for the first time. He was so excited to see the girl, he bought an amazing embroided jeans paired with any extremely ill- fitted out of fashion casual shirt. Needless to say, he was looking out of this world. That was the kind of fashion taste he used to have. Hema also didn’t followed fashion meticulously, but she was much much better than Nitin is this regard.
Both met. They kind of clicked. 
Present: Somewhere in the city, Advocate Anil Sharma’s office:
Anil- “Ok, are you sure you two want to file a divorce by mutual consent petition ?
Hema- Yes
Nitin- Yes
